# IDEA

Emoticon suggestor is kind of web tool we can say, which can be used to suggest emoticons according to words that are being typed and in the context of user's sentence.

## AIM
Motive behind starting this project is to make open source awareness among students and to create team work skills so that in future they won't face any issue in using collaborative tools like git/github, codespaces, etc.

### How
- First of all create an issue for any feature you want to build, anything you want to improve or report a bug
- Fork this repository to your github account
- Clone this repository to your local machine, change directory into project folder and run start command:
```bash
git clone [clone url from your forked repository]
cd emoticon-suggestor
npm start
```

- Create features, modify code, do your stuff and the create new branch (keep branch name conventional so that it would be easy to review and merge them), push your changes to this branch. Come back to github, and click compare and create pull request
- If you'd like to update documentation or readme file, you can also create issue for that as well or a pull request 

### Rules you might hate to follow
- Whenever creating a pull request, mention issue number in title, for example: Fixes [#6] or Resolves [#6]
- Please be kind to everyone, help each other, there's nothing like stupid question here, it is for noobs as well as for pro's ;)
